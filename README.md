Project Overview:
      -> There are lot of apps available to deliver food but not snacks.
      -> We here by come up with a solution of creating a app specifically designed to deliver snacks.
      -> We created a user friendly interface which will be easy to access for the users.
      -> Let us discuss more about our in the upcoming points.
      
working:

> There will be a button to register, user has to click that button and complete the registration by entering valid credentials.
      -> The user want to log in with the registered username and password.
      -> After validation the user will be taken to the home page there they can view the list of snacks. 
      -> They can order the snack they want by adding it to the cart.
      -> They can also monitor the order status in the app itself.
